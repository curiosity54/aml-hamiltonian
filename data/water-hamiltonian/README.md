`water_fock.npy`, `water_overlap.npy` are the Fock and overlap matrices in the def2-SVP basis. Please use the corresponding orbital file when working with them (`orbs_def2_water.json`)
`water_saph_orthogonal.npy` is the orthogonalized symmetry-adapted projected Hamiltonian (SAPH). The basis of projection is in the `water_orbs.json` file.
